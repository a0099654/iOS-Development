# iOS-Development
Programming-Language Used: swift
IOS Usage:
- UI View Controller
- UI Navigator Controller
- Segue
- Safari services

There are two folder:
1. WebBuild (Single page application build with JSON parser, segue, label, text, button)
2. BMICalc  (Single page application build with sliders, buttons)

This is my first attempt in building iOS application with swift programming language which is developed by Apple

Simple swift 

1. print "hello world"  (without any semicolon)
  Command line: hello world 
2. Integer declaration starts with upper case for the first letter
  Int, Double
3. String interpolation in swift
  "\(variable_name)"
  if you want to print my name is Stella: "My name is \(name)", when you've assigned name as Stella
4. Constant vs Variable in swift
  Constant: the value can't be change -> immutable. "let" will be used
  Variable: the value can be change. "var" will be used 
5. Optional (To unwrap optional variable , you should add exclamation mark behind it)
  name!
6. "if let" will help to unwrap optional
7. If you are not sure about optional variable or whether a dictionary can be found, you should use question mark ("?") behind the varibale name
